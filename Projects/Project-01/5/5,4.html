	Never a word I’ve feared more.
	<br>
	Never needed a label for adore.
	<br>
	Never a word I’ve desired for.
	<br>
	Never needed a word to make my heart sore. 
	<br>
	<br>
	This four letter word that strikes fear.
	<br>
	A four letter word that I desire to hear.
	<br>
	This four letter word that can burn and sear.
	<br>
	A four letter word that’s always held dear.
	<br>
	<br>
	What a four letter word can do to the soul.
	<br>
	What it can do to a heart of solid coal.
	<br>
	What a four letter that people extoll.
	<br>
	What is this L-O-V-E that we try to control?
